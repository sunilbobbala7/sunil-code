            <h2>How Does Call Recording Work?</h2>
            <p>Recording a call using Truecaller is a breeze, whether you're on iPhone or Android. For iPhone, merge the call with Truecaller's special recording line when prompted by the app. On Android, simply hit the "Rec" button during your call. In both cases, once the conversation ends, you'll get a push notification with the link to your recorded file. Just ensure that on iPhone, you merge the recording line and the call, and on Android, you initiate the recording with a tap. Regardless of the platform, Truecaller makes it seamless to record any call. Just remember to follow your local laws regarding call recording.</p>
